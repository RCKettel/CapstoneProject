## Business Understanding
Since the introduction of the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985 there has been a proliferation of new and more advanced gaming systems and videogames introduced to the global market.  Though many companies likely have methods and tools that would predict the success of new videogames, new tools could help game publishers determine the success of a game based on previous sales.  This may reduce the risk of a game that does not give a good return on investment and allow the company to invest thier resources in projects that would have a higher likelihood of success. 

## Data Understanding
The [Project Data](https://data.world/julienf/video-games-global-sales-in-volume-1983-2017) contains over 16,500 records of the sales of individual videogames in each major market from 1980 through 2020 including North America, Europe, and Japan ranked by the total global sales for that game.  The data for the games are common to each market and also contians the title, platform, genre, and publisher of each.
